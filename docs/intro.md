# Introduction

Welcome to the Flutter Lunch and Learn! Here we will be building a simple Weather app using the Flutter framework.

The objective of this tutorial is:

- Try Flutter hands on!
- Create a working weather app from scratch

This tutorial is suitable as a starter project for people who are just getting their feet wet in the Flutter world. 

We try our best to explain commonly skipped topic in details, and sprinkle notes and tips over many confusing places, so people who have less technical background can follow along with minimal efforts.

To get started, just follow the steps in this tutorial.
