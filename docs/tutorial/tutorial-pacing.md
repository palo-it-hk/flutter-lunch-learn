# Tutorial Pacing

If you are familiar with git, each step in this tutorial corresponds to a commit with the same message, in which the commit represents what the project should look like **AFTER** completing the step.

![Git tutorial steps](/img/docs/git-tutorial-steps.png)

This means you can checkout any steps and start the tutorial from that point if you feel like the tutorial pacing is too slow.

Also, you can compare your progress with the "standard answer" as provided in the commits. Take this with a grain of salt thought as there are no definite answers in the coding world :)

:::tip
We recommend creating your own local branch when you start this tutorial, commiting after each steps, and compare your progress with the `tutorial` branch.
